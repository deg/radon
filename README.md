## Introduction


### Why "Radon"?


### State of this project

Radon is still a early work in progress. I am using it to help me with other projects
and have only addded functionality that I need and can test.  Radon will only grow as

[checkouts directory](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
feature by sym-linking directly to your copy of Radon.

### Testing

needed. PRs especially welcome here.
