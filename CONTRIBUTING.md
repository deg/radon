# Contributing

I have started this project with the bare minimum needed for my immediate work. I will
add to it as I need.  If you find this project useful but missing pieces, it should be
easy for you to add. I am very happy to receive PRs filling in everything that I'm
missing. Even small contributions are valuable and welcome.

To help keep things organized, it would be good to open an issue and get my feedback
before you create a PR. But, often, this is overkill. Use your own judgement and
common-sense. :-)

All the usual GitHub and open-source guidelines apply. I'll elaborate further in
this document someday (or submit a PR for this!) but you won't go far wrong if you
follow common rules like those listed in
<https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines> or
