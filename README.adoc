= Radon

== Introduction

Radon is part of my elemental series of ClojureScript support projects, which also
includes https://github.com/deg/sodium[Sodium] and https://github.com/deg/iron[Iron],
with more to come soon (I hope).

Radon offers tools to make it easier to write
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/[React Native] applications in ClojureScript.

I started this project in February 2018, when I was still _very_ new to React Native.
As I write these words, I am only a couple of weeks from first touching this area, and
have not yet completed any real project.  So, tread carefully. My idea of best practices
and tools may change radically as I learn more. This project may change or you may find
that I've made mistakes.

Despite that warning, I do hope that this project is useful. As I learn, I am collecting
tidbits from other projects; sometimes cleaning them up; and inclduing them here. I am
very receptive to PRs to help this project grow. I hope it becomes a useful resource for
all of us trying to tame React Native in ClojureScript.

Radon owes a debt of gratitude to many other projects, especially
https://github.com/artemyarulin/ktoa[ktoa], from which I have learned much.


=== Why "Radon"?

I've adopted element names for this series of projects. Radon, if you squint your ears a
bit, sounds like React Native.

=== State of this project

Radon is still a early work in progress. I am using it to help me with other projects
and have only addded functionality that I need and can test.  Radon will only grow as
it helps me (or other contributers) accomplish what they need. If you need features now,
PRs are welcome.

:WARNING: More needed here 


If you want to contribute to this project, you will want to test your changes. You can
extend the (very minimal) tests inside Radon, but you will probably need to really test
by using Radon in a ClojureScript project. The easiest way to do this, while you are
changing Radon, is by using Leiningen's
[checkouts directory](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
feature by sym-linking directly to your copy of Radon.

== Using Radon

=== Internals

=== Testing

`lein doo phantom test auto` will run the few unit tests I've written so far. More are
needed. PRs especially welcome here.

== Questions

I can usually be found on the [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.net) slack
channels. My handle is @deg. Email is also fine.
